# Terminal Settings

I spend most of my time in emacs and second to that is the terminal.  I really canâ€™t stand bright white backgrounds and the default settings suck for me.

- Terminal -> Preferences
- Settings -> Select Homebrew -> Press Default
- Change -> Font size to 10
- Startup -> New Windows -> Same working directory
